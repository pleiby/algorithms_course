Week 3, DFS, Node distances and Bipartite Graph
-----------------------------------------------
- if use (ordered) list to contain node attributes (visited, distance, color),
    - do we need to be careful about node numberings that are not numbered sequentially from 1?
- Does Source node matter for BFS approach to alternate coloring?
    - it does for numbering, in terms of numbering level
    - but maybe not for relative distance, i.e. if number is even or odd?
- HOw does bipartite test deal with non-connected graphs?
- Graph plotting/visualization
    - blip with note labelling in matplotlib
