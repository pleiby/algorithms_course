"""
Starts by reading a graph.
Graphs are given as follows.
The first line contains non-negative integers 𝑛 and 𝑚 
 — the number of vertices and the number of edges respectively. 
The vertices are always numbered from 1 to 𝑛. 
Each of the following 𝑚 lines defines an edge in the format u v where
1 ≤ 𝑢, 𝑣 ≤ 𝑛 are endpoints of the edge. 
If the problem deals with an undirected graph this defines an undirected edge between 𝑢 and 𝑣. 
In case of a directed graph this defines a directed edge from 𝑢 to 𝑣. 
If the problem deals with a weighted graph 
then each edge is given as u v w where 𝑢 and 𝑣 are vertices and 𝑤 is a weight.
