# Following is a simple algorithm to find out whether a given graph is Birpartite or not using Breadth First Search (BFS).
# 1. Assign RED color to the source vertex (putting into set U).
# 2. Color all the neighbors with BLUE color (putting into set V).
# 3. Color all neighbor‚Äôs neighbor with RED color (putting into set U).
# 4. This way, assign color to all vertices such that it satisfies all
#    the constraints of m way coloring problem where m = 2.
# 5. While assigning colors,
#    if we find a neighbor which is colored with same color as current vertex,
#    then the graph cannot be colored with 2 vertices (or graph is not Bipartite)

#   can be colored with two colors (say, black and white) such that the
#   endpoints of each edge have different colors.
